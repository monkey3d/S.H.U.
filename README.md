The Project
SHU is a complete home automation project.
It includes home automation software, home automation sensors and actuators packaged based on the MySensors open source project, or with zigbee 3.0 compatible zigbee2mqtt modules or with Sonoff wifi modules.

All components are open-source and no features use a service from an internet provider.

The home automation software is developed with the Symfony framework and some bundles of the community.
